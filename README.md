# docker_vm_simulation
Project to spin up containers that are supposed to simulate Virtual Machines. These containers are quick to build, and quick to tear down.

This project does 2 things:
1. Spin up containers
2. creates an ansible inventory file of those containers

This will enable us to test ansible playbooks on containers, instead of in production.


## QUICKSTART
Spin up a predefined environment. 
Find predfined environments under 'environment/development/docker_vars'

E.g. ksat_old_prod.yml
```



```

## SLOW START
